# To-Do-App
MVVM to-do application written in kotlin focussed on (View/Viewmodel separation of concern). Improvement are always a learning moment.

Main focus has been on using events channel in the viewModel to make navigation decisions.

Thanking Andela and Google in the GADS program for the learning opportunity.
